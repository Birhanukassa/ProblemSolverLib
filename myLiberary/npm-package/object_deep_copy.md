# `deepCopy` Function

This Markdown file provides a comprehensive documentation for the `deepCopy` function, including its usage, function signature, implementation details, and limitations. You can include this file in your library's documentation to help other developers understand and use the `deepCopy` function effectively.


The `deepCopy` function is a utility function that performs a deep copy of the given object or array. It recursively copies the structure of the input, creating new instances of each nested object or array.

# Function Signature
function deepCopy(original: any): any

`Parameters`
    - original: any
        - The object or array to be copied.

`Return Value`
    - any
       - A deep copy of the original object or array.

`Implementation`
The deepCopy function works by checking the type of the input value. If the value is an array, it recursively copies each element using map. If the value is an object, it recursively copies each property using Object.entries and  Object.fromEntries. If the value is a primitive, it is simply returned as is.

```js
function deepCopy(original) {
  if (Array.isArray(original)) {
    return original.map(item => deepCopy(item));
  } else if (typeof original === 'object' && original !== null) {
    const copy = {};
    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(original)) {
      copy[key] = deepCopy(value);
    }
    return copy;
  } else {
    // Primitive value: atomic, no need to copy
    return original;
  }
}
```

## Usage

```js
const original = { a: 1, b: { c: 2, d: { e: 3 } } };
const copy = deepCopy(original);

// Are copy and original deeply equal?
console.log(JSON.stringify(copy) === JSON.stringify(original)); // true

// Did we really copy all levels?
console.log(copy !== original); // true
console.log(copy.b !== original.b); // true
console.log(copy.b.d !== original.b.d); // true
```

# Limitations

The deepCop function can handle most common data structures, including nested objects and arrays. However, it does not handle certain edge cases, such as:

   - Copying functions or other non-serializable values

   - Copying objects with circular references

In these cases, you may need to use alternative approaches, such as the `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original))` method, which has its own limitations.
