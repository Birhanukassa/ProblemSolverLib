/*

Your goal is to write the group_and_count method, which should receive and array as unique parameter and return a hash. Empty or nil input must return nil instead of a hash. This hash returned must contain as keys the unique values of the array, and as values the counting of each value.

Example usage:

input = [1,1,2,2,2,3]

group_and_count(input)# == {1=>2, 2=>3, 3=>1}
The following methods were disabled:

Array#count
Array#length



Test.assert_equals(group_and_count([0,1,1,0]), {0=>2, 1=>2})
