// Write a function named toWeirdCase that accepts a string,
// and returns the same sequence of characters with every
// 4th character in every second word converted to
// uppercase. Other characters should remain the same.

// Examples:

console.log(
  toWeirdCase('Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing world') ===
              'Lorem IpsUm is simPly dummy texT of the printing worLd');
console.log(
  toWeirdCase('It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted') ===
              'It is a lonG established facT that a reader wilL be disTracTed');
console.log(toWeirdCase('aaA bB c') === 'aaA bB c');
console.log(
  toWeirdCase('Miss Mary Poppins word is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious') ===
              'Miss MarY Poppins worD is supErcaLifrAgilIstiCexpIaliDociOus');

// The tests above should print "true".
